Interested in making maps for the web? This workshop might be the perfect place to start!

We will spend the first two hours guiding you through the basics of crafting web maps with Leaflet.js, and then spend the second half building cool things with what we’ve learned.

Some of the topics we’ll cover include:

* Getting started with Leaflet
* Adding markers, lines, & other geometry
* Interactivity
* Useful plugins for extending Leaflet.
* Fun datasources for local, national, and international mapping.

We will do our best to accommodate all skill levels, but you will get the most out of this workshop if you have a passing familiarity with Javascript.

Stuff to bring or do beforehand:

* Your own laptop (PC or Mac)
* Install a text editor (like Sublime Text) for writing code
* Sign up for a free GitHub account

Lunch will be provided (please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions).

All attendees are expected to abide by the OpenDayton Code of Conduct.
